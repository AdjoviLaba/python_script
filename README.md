# python_script
In this modified script, we add an additional field package_install_date 
to store the installation date. For CentOS, we use the INSTALLTIME tag 
to extract the installation date, while for Debian, we use the Install-Date field. 
The installation dates are then included in the printed output for the installed packages.
